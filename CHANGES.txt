v0.2.0-alpha, 2018-02-14 -- Draft with CFGeometryCollection and CF compliance

Compliant with draft CF geometry proposal (see pull request 115 under the 
cf-conventions). Code was made compliant by migrating from coordinate indirection 
versions of code (v0.1.0).

v0.1.0-ALPHA, 2017-03-15 -- Initial release, prototype with coordinate indirection

The prototype Python code in this version uses coordinate indirection via a
coordinate index variable. Break values are inserted into the index to represent
polygon holes or parts in multipart geometries. The code was authored by @bekozi.
With the project moving away from this kind of coordinate indexing, this release
serves to preserve that code.
